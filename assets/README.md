# Git Ignore is a BEAUTIFUL thing

If you are reading this message in a blank ASSETS folder, then you are in the right place. 

Using gitignore, I have hidden all of the files that would be here (like product exports, order exports, customer info, etc.)

This data could be sensitive, and thus should not be uploaded ever to Github.
